3. After installing the dependencies run `npm start` to start the expo server
4. Read the console and start the appropriate dev environment using your keyboard (a for android, w for web,..)
5. Make your changes/improvements to the code
6. Make sure that your code works
7. (Make a new branch/fork the repo) and push your changes
8. Make a new Pull Request
9. Wait for your Pull Request to be approved.
